## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The platform is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, employing a component-based structure for modularity. It features a responsive design using CSS variables and modern styling, with progressive enhancement ensuring basic functionality even without JavaScript. Key UI/UX decisions include an iOS-style liquid glass navigation bar, subtle glassmorphism effects across the interface, premium button designs, and a sophisticated animated gradient background. Typography uses the Inter font, and partner logos are scaled for visual hierarchy. The application provides a user-friendly 5-step interactive tutorial with glassmorphism modals and supports bilingual content (English and Kinyarwanda). The form structure is streamlined into four sections for improved user experience, and a dynamic multi-position system allows efficient data entry.

### Backend Architecture
Firebase serves as the Backend-as-a-Service, utilizing Firestore for real-time data storage of surveys, responses, and user data. Firebase Authentication handles admin user management, eliminating the need for a custom backend server.
